## Intro — What We're Doing

Some terminology and site conventions may need a bit of explaining.

## A Bit on Script File Features

This is a quick intro to what you’ll find in the demo scripts used on this blog, but before we go there, let’s start with some terminology...

### Parent or Parent?

		</div>
		
		<script>
		// Get the modal
		var modal = document.getElementById("modalm");													// modal#
		
		// Get the image and insert it inside the modal - use its "alt" text as a caption
		var img = document.getElementById("imgm");														// img#
		var modalImg = document.getElementById("imgmm");												// img##
		var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");

		img.onclick = function()
		{
		  modal.style.display = "block";
		  modalImg.src = this.src;
		  captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
		}
		
		// Get the <span> element that closes the modal
		var span = document.getElementsByClassName("closem")[0];										// close#
		
		// When the user clicks on <span> (x), close the modal
		span.onclick = function()
		{ 
			modal.style.display = "none";
		}
		</script>

</div>

One of the things that trips up those new to a GUI toolkit that allows OOP-style code is how the term *parent* is used. And with two specific meanings, there are two definitions:

- a parent is a widget containing another widget, and
- a parent is also the class from which another class is derived.

To avoid this confusion, I’ll refer to various objects, widgets, and classes thusly:

- a widget that contains another widget is a *parent*,
- a widget contained by another widget is a *child*,
- a class from which another class is derived, is the *super-class*, and
- a class derived from another class is the *derived* class.

### Special Comments

If you take a look at the screenshot above, you’ll see that each class definition I write has comments that appear in almost every one of them. Here’s an explanation:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Comment</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td class="code"># object attributes</td><td class="text">Variables specific to a class and all objects instantiated from it</td></tr><tr><td class="code"># configure</td><td class="text">Statements configuring various class/object attributes</td></tr><tr><td class="code"># populate</td><td class="text">If the widget object contains child widgets, they go here</td></tr><tr><td class="code"># layout</td><td class="text" markdown="span">A convenience for complex `grid()` layouts.</td></tr></table>

#### Layout – Just to Clarify Further

		var modalImg = document.getElementById("imgnn");												// img##
		var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");

		img.onclick = function()
		{
		  modal.style.display = "block";
		  modalImg.src = this.src;
		  captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
		}
		
		// Get the <span> element that closes the modal

If a child widget is the only child of a parent widget, the call to `grid()` will be made from within the child’s `__init__()` method.

But if there are lots of widgets—a complex layout—it’s easier to tweak the layout if all the `grid()` calls are made from the parent. Even after the layout is tweaked to within an inch of its life, it’s probably best to leave these `grid()` statements in the parent in case a later code revision sees you adding another child or two.

### The grid() Method

And speaking of... you may ask: what exactly is the `grid()` method when it’s at home?

The short answer is: it's one way to get a widget to show up in a GUI layout. There are three methods for doing this and they are:

- `place()` — put a widget at exact coordinates within the `Window`, `Frame`, etc.,
- `pack()` — stuff the widget into virtual boxes, either horizontal or vertical, and
- `grid()` — use virtual rows and columns... in short, a table.

Most of the time, `grid()` is all we need, so unless it's absolutely necessary to use one of the others, that's what we'll stick with.

### Self

The `self` identifier is used when a class needs to refer to—big surprise—itself. Some languages use `this`, but *Python* uses `self`. Giving objects a way to identify themselves *to* themselves is a fundamental part of OOP.

#### Attributes

*Attribute* is just a fancy way of saying *variable*. The difference is that attributes are only found inside classes whereas variables can be in any scope within your code. Suffice to say, there won't be any variables in any of these demos... probably.

Attributes are defined within the `__init__()` method (in the `#object attribute` section, in fact) and use the `self` prefix—as mentioned earlier—so they can be accessed from anywhere within the instantiated object. Here are a couple of examples:

```python
self.width = 100
self.height = 200
self.geometry = "100x200"
```

#### Defining a Child Widget

This is the other common use of `self`. Whenever a child widget is defined, the parent has to identify itself to the child like this:

```python
self.child_widget = ChildWidget(self)
```

Within the child's `__init__` method definition, the parent is identified this:

```python
def __init__(self, parent):
```

Then, when the child calls `self.grid()`, nothing more needs to be done. *tkinter* has enough information to figure out the parent/child relationship.

## Conclusion

But all this is academic. Next time, we’ll start to see these things in action.
