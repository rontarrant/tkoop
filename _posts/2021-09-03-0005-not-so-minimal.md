## Introduction

Today we’ll look at how to code a minimal OOP window with a minimal OOP frame containing a minimal OOP label. It might not seem like much, but we'll discover a number of interesting things along the way.

## And Now, a Widget within a Widget within a Widget

Here’s what the code looks like:

```python
from *tkinter* import *
from *tkinter* import ttk

def main():
	window = Window()
	window.mainloop()

class Window(Tk):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		# object attributes
		self.mainframe = MainFrame(self)
		# configure
		#populate
		self.mainframe.grid()

class MainFrame(ttk.Frame):
	def __init__(self, window):
		super().__init__(window)
		# object attributes
		self.label = Label(self)
		# configure
		# populate
		self.label.grid()

class Label(ttk.Label):
	def __init__(self, parent):
		super().__init__(parent, text = "This is a label inside a frame inside a window.")
		
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

### Breakdown - The Window Class

The first `import` line is the same one we've been using all along. However, the second (`from *tkinter* import ttk`) takes us into new territory. It gives us access to the updated `ttk` widgets.

In short, these widgets take on the visual appearance closer to that of the operating system your script is run on. Not all widgets have a `ttk` version and perhaps they never will. But, if you use ttk widgets and they still look dated, you can tell your users that it’s not your fault.

#### Populating the Window Class

First, we define the child:

```python
self.mainframe = MainFrame(self)
```

Here we see what we were talking about last time. The parent identifies itself to *tkinter* as parent to the child widget being defined. That’s the right side of the equation. On the left, we use `self` to make sure we can access the `mainframe` attribute from any Window class methods we may write.

Because the layout of this demo isn’t complicated, we’ll let the children take care of their own `grid()` calls.

### Breakdown - The Mainframe Class

```python
class MainFrame(ttk.Frame):
	def __init__(self, window):
		super().__init__(window)
		# object attributes
		self.label = Label(self)
		# configure
		self.grid()
```

As usual, the first statement in `__init__()` calls the super-class constructor and passes along the parent. This is the line I’m talking about:

```python
super().__init__(window)
```

Next, we see this line:

```python
self.label = Label(self)
```

Which is a repeat of what happened in the Window class, but with a different child widget.

Lastly, we do the layout stuff:

```python
self.grid()
```

Easy-peasey. Nothing complex about that layout.

### Breakdown - Label Class

```python
class Label(ttk.Label):
	def __init__(self, parent):
		super().__init__(parent, text = "This is a label inside a frame inside a window.")
```

By now, I’m sure you’re seeing the repetitiveness in these classes. Dull they may be, but by keeping them consistent, we make things easy on ourselves... they’re easy to understand, expand, and modify to suit a specific purpose. If we don’t have to spend even a moment understanding how a class is defined, we get to spend more time and energy doing the fun stuff and nailing down those bits of code that will be inevitably be tough.

The call to `super().__init__()` breaks with site conventions we’ve established, but it’s done in the name of taking things one step at a time. The second argument tells *tkinter* what we want the label to say. In later examples, we’ll do those things after the fact in the `#configure` section.

## Conclusion
