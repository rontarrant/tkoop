## About Tkooper

Here we talk about Tkinter & Object-oriented Python, demonstrating the
widgets as run-able examples written in the object-oriented
paradigm. The goal is comprehensive coverage of everything the toolkit
has to offer from simple windows to more complex layouts, all adhering to good design standards.

To understand my qualifications for these tasks, please read on...

## Who's This Programmer, Anyway?

Inspired by my Dad, I learned programming while vacationing in a frozen Newfoundland outport in April of 1985. It started as a desperate attempt to keep boredom at bay, but soon became a lifelong passion.

In keeping with this non-typical start, it was in art college where I learned my first serious programming language (6502 assembly). I wrote code in my head while biking to campus and was always surprised, after typing it in, that it actually worked first try! By 1989, I was a full-on developer, writing such things as Animation Bridge (an animation file format converter for the Amiga selected for inclusion on the—at the time—well-known [Fish Disks](https://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/fish.html)) and several small audio manipulation utilities with extremely long names (*ChangeSpeedWithoutChangingPitch*, and *ChangePitchWithoutChangingSpeed* just to name a couple). By the late 1990's, I was working as a technical writer, artist and web developer, cranking out mortgage calculators and other such utilities for credit unions just dipping their toes into the Internet waters for the first time.

## And Who's This Graphic Designer?

I graduated from the Emily Carr College of Art & Design in 1989 where I concentrated on 3D animation. This was long before any college anywhere offered an official 3D animation programme.  That summer, I hastily put together an animated short and submitted it to the *Montreal International Animation Festival* and got an honourable mention. I was also the first person to produce lip-synced animation using only a personal computer. But, being so far ahead of my time, I ended up working in the field for a mere six months before the local job market dried up. Not long after, I went to work for a small ISP in the art department and as it turned out, they needed a designer more than an artist, so they sent me back to Emily Carr to learn design. For the next four years, I studied and poured out layouts for everything from brochures to web sites.

Since then, I've brought programming and graphic design together several times, not only for my own web design company, but also to write blogs covering GUI toolkits. So far, this is my third, the first two being for PHP-GTK and GtkD. The first was lost when an early blog site went belly up. The second you can find here: [https://gtkdcoding.com](https://gtkdcoding.com)

## What About That Other Stuff? 

But programming and graphic design aren't the only things I've done in my life. Since dropping out of high school in 1972, I've also made a living as a cabdriver, musician, screenwriter, technical writer, 3D modeller/animator, artist, sound reinforcement technician and salesman, a biology lab technician, and delivery driver... among other things. I've also made money (but not an actual living) acting, and promoting concerts. I retired from Statistics Canada in 2010 and have since divided my time between acting, writing lame science fiction novels, and pursuing the elusive X-plat beast... all this while keeping house for my wife of 33 years. Needless to say, I'm not groping around for things to do.

And that pretty much brings us to the present where I'm under lock-down along with the rest of the world as we wait to see how big a deal this COVID-19 thing turns out to be.
