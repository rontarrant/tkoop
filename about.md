I was inspired to learn programming while vacationing in a frozen Newfoundland outport in April of 1985. It started as a desperate attempt to keep boredom at bay, but became one more lifelong passion along with acting, writing, and music.

In keeping with this non-typical start, it was in art college where I learned my first serious programming language (6502 assembly). I wrote code in my head while biking to the campus and was always surprised, after typing it in, that it actually worked first time! By 1989, I was a full-on developer, writing such things as Animation Bridge (an animation file format converter for the Amiga) and several small audio manipulation utilities with extremely long names (ChangeSpeedWithoutChangingPitch, and ChangePitchWithoutChangingSpeed to name a couple). By the late 1990's, I was working as a technical writer, artist and web developer, cranking out mortgage calculators and other such stuff for credit unions just dipping their toes into the Internet waters for the first time.

Since then, the main programming-oriented things that keep me occupied are GUI toolkit demos written in the OOP paradigm. So far, this is my third blog, the first two being for PHP-GTK and GtkD. The first was lost when an early blog site went belly up. The second you can find here: [https://gtkdcoding.com](https://gtkdcoding.com)

But programming hasn't been all I've done in my life. Since dropping out of high school in 1972, I've made a living as a cabdriver, musician, screenwriter, technical writer, 3D modeler/animator, artist, sound reinforcement technician and salesman, a biology lab technician, and delivery driver... among other things. I've also made money (but not an actual living) acting, programming, and promoting concerts. I retired from Statistics Canada in 2010 and have since divided my time between acting, writing lame science fiction novels, pursuing the elusive X-plat beast... all this while keeping house for my wife of 33 years. Needless to say, I'm not groping around for things to do.

And that pretty much brings us to the present where I'm under lock-down along with the rest of the world as we wait to see how big a deal the COVID-19 pademic turns out to be.
